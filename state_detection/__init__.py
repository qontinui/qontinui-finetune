"""
State Detection Fine-tuning Module

This module provides utilities and scripts for fine-tuning state detection models
on specific GUI types and applications.

Fine-tuning allows adaptation of pre-trained state detection models to:
- Specific application domains (e.g., web apps, desktop apps, mobile)
- Particular UI frameworks (e.g., Electron, Qt, React)
- Custom state taxonomies for specific applications
- Domain-specific transition patterns

Components:
- Fine-tuning scripts for state detection models
- Domain adaptation utilities
- Custom state vocabulary management
- Evaluation tools for fine-tuned models
